# Store the number 100 into a variable named cars
# Number of cars available: 100
cars = 100
# Store the floating-point number 4.0 into a variable named
# space_in_a_car
# Space available in each car 4.0
space_in_a_car = 4.0 # floating-point not neccessary
# Store the number 30 into a variable named drivers
# number of drivers available: 30
drivers = 30
# Store the number 90 into a variable named passengers
# Number of passengers available: 90
passengers = 90
# Calculate the value of the variables cars - drivers
# Store the new value into a variable named cars_not_driven
cars_not_driven = cars - drivers
# Store the value in the variable drivers into a variable named
# cars_driven
cars_driven = drivers
# Calculate the value of the variables cars_driven * space_in_a_car
# Store the new value into a variable named carpool_capacity
carpool_capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car
# Calculate the value of the variables passengers / cars_driven
# Store the new value into a variable named average_passengers_per_car
average_passengers_per_car = passengers / cars_driven
